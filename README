Amazon-highlights
Scrape public highlights off of the Amazon Kindle website.

Using the Scrapy framework and a MySQL backend, this tool can grab public highlights off of the Amazon Kindle website.

The apt-get file is a not-comprehensive list of items needed to apt-get (I was using Ubuntu) in order for the python libraries to install.
The fabfile is used to deploy the code to a remote server and install all requirements within a specified virtualenv.
To get this running locally, one only needs to make sure the python requirements are installed using 'pip install -r requirements.txt' within a virtualenv (or not, your choice). The fabfile is not necessary for running locally.
You'll need to set up a mysql server either locally or remotely and place the values of MYSQL_HOST, MYSQL_PW, MYSQL_USER, and MYSQL_NAME within a file called config.py inside the same folder as pipelines.py.
I've provided the mysql file to show how to create the mysql tables necessary. Alternatively, you can use an ORM such as peewee.
If you don't wish to use a mysql server, you can write everything to file using json by altering the pipeline this program uses.
